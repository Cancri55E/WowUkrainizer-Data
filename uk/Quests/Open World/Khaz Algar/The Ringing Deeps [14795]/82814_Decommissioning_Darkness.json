    "Description": "Decommissioning a machine is a rare necessity. It must be done with care and regret.\n\nWe put much of ourselves into our work. To destroy it is to destroy a part of ourselves. In doing so, we admit our failure to protect the Titans' work.  But where stone rebels against stone, we must stand firm.\n\nImperative: Destroy it. Recover Arbauch's memory gem.",
