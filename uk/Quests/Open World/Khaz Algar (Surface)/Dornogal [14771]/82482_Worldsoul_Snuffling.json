Of course, I hardly have time, but when I do... there's such surprises everywhere!\n\nTreasures, friends in need, foes great and small... All so wonderful. \n\nI'll just have to live vicariously through you. Deeds need doing! Go out and seek the surprises in every nook and cranny. I'm certain you will find things that need doing!",
