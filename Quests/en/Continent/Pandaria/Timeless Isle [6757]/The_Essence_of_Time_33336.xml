  <Title>The Essence of Time</Title>
  <Description>It is about time that I revealed to you my purpose on this island.$b$bThe bronze dragonflight's powers have diminished greatly - we can now only catch furtive glimpses through time. It is... quite frustrating.$b$bBut we are not entirely without means. I hold in my hand the Vision of Time, an artifact of my own creation. The creatures of this isle have passed through time, and may carry with them some of its essence. With it, we will fill the hourglass, granting us a window into the timeways once more.</Description>
