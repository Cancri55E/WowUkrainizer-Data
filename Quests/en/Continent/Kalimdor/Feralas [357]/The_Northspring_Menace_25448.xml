  <Title>The Northspring Menace</Title>
  <Description>My duty here is to watch over Telaron. Even without his meditation leaving him vulnerable, there's enough threats in this forest to keep both of us on our toes.$B$BThat's why it maddens me so much that I don't have the opportunity to leave camp. More harpies than I've ever seen infest the northwest...foul creatures, spreading their filth across the ancient ruins uncaringly.$B$BThey're a threat to this camp, and have no place in these lands. I'll pay you well if you get rid of them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 6 Northspring Harpies and 6 Northspring Windcallers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. That's one less distraction for me.</RewardText>
